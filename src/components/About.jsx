                exploretech.la is an annual event hosted by UCLA students that
                aims to inspire high school students from underserved
                communities in the Greater Los Angeles Area to explore computer
                science, engineering, and technology.
              </p>
              <p>
                In partnership with industry and academic organizations, our
                event introduces students to the various applications of tech
                through our panels, interactive workshops, and exhibition hall.
              </p>
              <p>
                Last year, exploretech.la welcomed over 500 students back in-person 
                after a year online due to COVID-19 and we are looking forward to hosting 
                exploretech.la in person once again this year.
              </p>
              <p>
                The event will take place <b>April 21, 2023</b>, and we would

              Founded in 2017 as student organization at UCLA, exploretech.la is
              run by students for students. We apply our insights as recent high
              school graduates to create engaging and impactful learning
              experiences for our younger peers. We believe that every student
              should have equal access to STEM education and opportunities.

            While continuing to follow the guidance of government and school

            We will continue to monitor and adjust as the situation requires,
            but are optimistic in our ability to bring back high schoolers
            safely to UCLA campus in April.
